- 👋 Hi, I’m @dariusgatsby a 23 year old DevOps engineer from Los Angeles, California!
- 🤔 I'm heavily interested in the field of DevOps and have been devoting myself to learning the most widely used tools in the industry over the past month, really trying to get my hands dirty and prove I will be a valuable asset to any team I join.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Github Actions, and programming langauges like Python. (I really really want to learn GO it just speaks to me haha).
- The field of tech has lead me to new loves like coding and game development 🎮, so I plan to try my hand at UE5 in the near future! But it also keeps me in touch with my good friend learning, we can never seem to escape each other! 💌
- 👨‍💻 Tech I'm familiar with: AWS and its core services (EC2, S3, Route53, Lambda, API gateway etc), Docker 🐳(thanks Bret!), Python 🐍, Linux 🐧, Git, and cybersecurity best practices.
- 📫 Ways to reach me: email: [dariusid08@gmail.com](dariusid08@gmail.com), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darius-daugherty/) 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe confidence in ones own ability is the only way to move forward in life 🧘‍♂️ ... and projects.
