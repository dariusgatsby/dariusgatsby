- 👋 Hi, I’m @dariusgatsby a 23 year old DevOps engineer from Los Angeles, California!
- 🤔 I'm fascinated with the field of computer science and have been devoting myself to learning the most widely used tools in the industry and discovering niche things I love. I'm really trying to get my hands dirty and prove I will be a valuable asset to any team I join!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Github Actions, and programming langauges like Python and Go. Everyday I strive to enhance my problem solving skills by asking better questions and being diligent in thought.
- The field of tech has lead me to new loves like coding and game development 🎮, so I plan to try my hand at UE5 in the near future! But it also keeps me in touch with my good friend learning, we can never seem to escape each other! 💌
- 👨‍💻 Tech I'm familiar with: AWS and its core services (EC2, S3, Route53, Lambda, API gateway etc), Docker 🐳(thanks Bret!), Python 🐍, Linux 🐧, and Git.
- 📫 Ways to reach me: email: [dariusid08@gmail.com](dariusid08@gmail.com), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darius-daugherty/) 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe confidence in ones own ability, and to lack fear of failure is the only way to move forward in life 🧘‍♂️ ... and projects.
